# FATN_to_USB
Farnham and Alton Talking News (FATN)  is a volunteer service which provides a service for blind and partially sighted by reading local newspapers and providing the recordings via USB.  Recently they have been unable to send the USBs by post, so they publish the files on their website :https://www.fatntalkingnews.org.uk/
